 # Wake-Word Detection Project [Work in Progress]
 
This is an experimental project on an implementation of a TinyML wake-word detection system running on the STM32F746G-DISCO board.

The end goal is a fully embedded pipeline: Audio → Feature Extraction (DSP) → CNN Inference → Command Detection → Response
